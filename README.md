# BIOMEDICAL

## Description
Biomedical is a web designed designed with Django, a Python Framework. This webpage is used for the administration patients, medicals, studies, results, doctors, etc

Working on it :)

## Libraries
For this webpage to function, you'll need some libraries that are specified in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
The libraries are:
```
asgiref==3.5.2
cffi==1.15.1
cryptography==38.0.3
Django==4.1.2
pycparser==2.21
PyMySQL==1.0.2
sqlparse==0.4.3
```

## Instalation

#### Cloning the Repo
The first thing we have to do is clone the github repository with the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/MateMar04/Biomedica```

#### Creating Virtual Environment
This step is optional but we suggest you to do it to avoid dependencies and performance issues.
We can create a virtual environment with the librarie called virtualenv that is installed by default in ubuntu. We create the environment with the following command:
```virtualenv <virtualenv_name>```
Then we activate it with the following command:
```source activate <virtualenv_name/bin/activate>```
We will see the name of the name of the virtual environment closed by round brackets

#### Installing Libraries
We have to the level of the ```requirements.txt``` file, we open a Terminal at that directory and run the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
This command is going to install the specified  versions of each library in the ```requirements.txt``` file.
